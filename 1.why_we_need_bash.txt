BASH - Bourne Again SHell
It is a shell scripting language.

"What's a shell?" you ask? 
A shell is a computer program that allows you to directly control a 
computer's operating system (OS) with a graphical user interface (GUI) or 
command-line interface (CLI).

Bash can be used to automate software development tasks such as code compilation, 
debugging source code, change management and software testing. 
Network engineers use Bash to test, configure and optimize network performance 
on organizational networks.

To run the bash code
Go to the directory where code file is present
Change permissions of file using
>> chmod +x ./file.shell
Then run the file
>> ./file.sh
